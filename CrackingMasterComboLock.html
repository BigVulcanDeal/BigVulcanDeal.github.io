positions for the third wheel by pulling up firmly on shackle and finding where the dial &quot;freezes&quot;. &nbsp;There are 12 such gate positions. &nbsp;Eleven of these are &ldquo;false&rdquo; gates, and one is the &quot;real&quot; gate. &nbsp;This real gate has two &quot;tells&quot;:</span></p><ul class="c4 lst-kix_b0sdd0dn67ev-0 start"><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c3">It&#39;s the only &quot;whole number&quot; position with a different last digit than the others (in my case, whole numbers were 0, 10, 20, 30 and </span><span class="c3 c8">37</span><span class="c0">)</span></li><li class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">It has the widest &quot;range&quot; when locked .. false gates allow you to twist the dial about +/- 1/2 &quot;tick&quot;, the real gate allows you to twist it a bit more. &nbsp;Position 37 was wider than the others, soI now knew that the last digit of the combo was 37.</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">And at this point, the online guides seemed to go awry, so I had to tap into my rudimentary grasp of lock anatomy. &nbsp;Most guides claim that the first digit will be mod 4 congruent to the last digit, which would yield candidates 1, 5, ... &nbsp;37 for the first digit. &nbsp;This turned out to be incorrect, and here&rsquo;s how I applied anatomical knowledge of the lock to figure this out. &nbsp;I turned the clock several times clockwise, and stopped with 0 at the top position .. then I turned it counterclockwise until I felt the third wheel engaging the 2nd wheel (</span><span class="c3 c9">bump</span><span class="c3">) when 38 was at the top. &nbsp;I kept turning until I felt the 2nd wheel engage the first wheel (</span><span class="c3 c9">bump</span><span class="c0">) when 34 was at the &nbsp;top. &nbsp;This suggested that the first digit is congruent to the (third digit + 6) modulo 4 .. yielding candidates 3, 7, 11 ... 39, rather than 1, 5 ... 37. &nbsp;And I knew that the 2nd digit would be a number that was in the set (1st digit + 2) mod 4 .. so the candidates for the 2nd position were 1, 5, ... 37. &nbsp; Of course, 37 was not feasible, since it was too close to the known last digit of 37 .. so I was left with as many as 90 combinations to try.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of the online guides also claim that you get the first number of the combination directly by feeling when the (superfluous) wheel catch on the back of wheel 1 brushes the shackle retainer. &nbsp;My lock didn&rsquo;t seem to have that issue, so I had to just plow through all possible combinations.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Fortunately, the correct combination, </span><span class="c3 c8">11, 17, 37</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was reached pretty quickly, and </span><span class="c0">the lock popped open.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hacky-New Year!</span></p></body></html>
